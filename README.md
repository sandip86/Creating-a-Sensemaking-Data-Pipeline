# Creating a Sensemaking Data Pipeline
### In this project, you will use the Python urllib library to pull data from MITâ€™s course catalog. The data being pulled from the web will be unstructured, so you will have to clean it first to extract the course names. Once the course names are extracted and the data is structured, you will perform some data analysis to learn how many times each word occurs throughout all of the course names. This analysis will be saved as a JSON file, which will then be referenced by your D3 web application. Lastly, the web application will generate a visual analysis of the JSON data that you just collected. To streamline the data analysis process, you will use software tools that you have learned about in previous modules, such as Docker and Airflow. You will be responsible for instantiating an Airflow web server within a Docker container to handle each Python task that you define. These tasks will divide the project into smaller, more manageable pieces. In the end, you will experiment with different D3 libraries to customize your project.
